## Installation

```bash
pip install pybenchx
# or
uv pip install pybenchx
```

## Your first benchmark

Create a file `examples/hello_bench.py`:

```python
from pybench import bench

@bench(name="hello", n=1000, repeat=10)
def hello():
    return sum(range(50))
```

Run it:

```bash
pybench examples/
```

Filter by name and tweak parameters at runtime:

```bash
pybench examples/ -k hello -P repeat=5 -P n=10_000
```

For stable numbers during development:

```bash
pybench examples/ --profile fast  # budgetâ‰ˆ150ms, repeat=10
```
